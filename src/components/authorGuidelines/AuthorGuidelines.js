          <p>
            IJAFMS uses a double-blind review, which means the identities of the
            authors are concealed from the reviewers, and vice versa. To
            facilitate this, please include the following separately:

          <p>
            <b>Regular Research Article:</b> This should describe new and/or
            carefully investigated findings, and research methods should be
            given in sufficient detail for others to verify the work. Articles
            should be
            <b>5,000 - 7,000 words long</b> to describe and interpret the work
            clearly. All regular research articles are peer-reviewed by minimum
            3 referees.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Short Communication Article:</b> This short communication is
            suitable for reporting the results of small investigations or giving
            details of new models, innovative methods or techniques. The style
            of main sections doesn’t need to conform to that of full-length
            papers. Short communications should be usually
            <b>3,000~5,000 words long.</b>
            Short communication articles are also peer-reviewed.

          <p>
            In order to submit your paper, please send your manuscript and
            associated files in <b>MS Word format</b> by e-mail to the
            <b>Editorial : ijafms@gmail.com.</b> Authors are encouraged to
            include tables and figures as part of the main file. All manuscripts
            must be accompanied by a letter which indicates briefly why the
            article is suitable for publication in the IJAFMS and attests that
            “The article has not been previously published and is not under
            review elsewhere“. All manuscripts must be prepared according to the
            IJAFMS submission guidelines.

          <h3>2.1. Language</h3>
          <p>
            Please write your text in good English (American or British usage is
            accepted, but not a mixture of these).
          </p>

          <h3>2.2. Word Count</h3>
          <p>
            While no maximum length for manuscripts is prescribed, authors are
            encouraged to write concisely and clearly. As a guide, short
            communications should be between 3,000 – 5,000 words and regular
            articles should be between 5,000 - 7,000 words in length.
            <br />
            However, any of full papers should be no more than 10 pages in its
            final printed product and no more than 8,000 words in total with all
            inclusive.

          <h3>2.3. Style of Presentation</h3>
          <p>
            1) Use A4 or Letter sheet size.
            <br />
            <br />
            2) Margins should be 20mm for A4 size and one inch (25mm) for Letter
            size at the top, bottom, and sides of the page.
            <br />
            <br />
            3) Font type should be 12-point Times Roman throughout the document.
            <br />
            <br />
            4) Double-space all body text, including abstract, references, end
            notes and appendices.
            <br />
            <br />
            5) Number all pages in your manuscript, starting with the Abstract
            page.
            <br />
            <br />
            6) Manuscript text should be left-aligned.

          <h3>2.4. Use of Word Processing Software</h3>
          <p>
            It is important that the file be saved in the native format of the
            word processor used. The text should be in single-column format.
            Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. Most formatting
            codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. Do not
            embed "graphically designed" equations or tables, but prepare these
            using the word processor's facility. Do not import the figures into
            the text file but, instead, indicate their approximate locations
            directly in the electronic text and on the manuscript. To avoid
            unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the "spell-check"
            and "grammar-check" functions of your word processor.

          <p>
            Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections.
            Subsections should be numbered 1.1. (then 1.1.1., 1.1.2., ...),
            1.2., etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). Use
            this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just
            refer to "the text". Any subsection may be given a brief heading.
            Each heading should appear on its own separate line.

            footnote to be placed on the first page of the article. Such
            abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined

            Present simple formulae in the line of normal text where possible.
            In principle, variables are to be presented in italics. Use the
            solidus (/) instead of a horizontal line, (e.g., X p /Y m). Powers
            of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. Number
            consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separate from

            letters; between the letter O and zero; between the letter I, the
            number one and prime; between k and kappa. The numbers identifying

            artwork.
            <br />
            <br /> 2) Save text in illustrations as "graphics" or enclose the
            font.
            <br />
            <br /> 3) Only use the following fonts in your illustrations: Arial,
            Courier, Times, Symbol.
            <br />
            <br /> 4) Number the illustrations according to their sequence in
            the text.
            <br />
            <br /> 5) Provide captions to illustrations separately.
            <br />
            <br /> 6) Produce images near to the desired size of the printed
            version.
            <br />
            <br /> 7) Submit each figure as a separate file. Please do not:
            <br />
            <br /> 8) Supply embedded graphics in your word processor document;
            <br />
            <br /> 9) Supply files that are optimized for screen use (like GIF,
            BMP, PICT, WPG);
            <br />
            <br /> 10) Supply files that are too low in resolution;
            <br />
            <br /> 11) Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the
            content.

            together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures
            then the Publisher will ensure that these figures will appear in
            color in the printed version. For color reproduction in print, you
            will receive information regarding the costs from the Publisher
            after receipt of your accepted article. Please note: Because of
            technical complications which can arise by converting color figures
            to "gray scale" (for the printed version should you not opt for
            color in print) please submit in addition usable black and white

            All citations in the text should refer to:
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Single author:</b> the author's name (without initials, unless

            When citing a list of references in the text, put the list in
            alphabetical order and separate authors by semicolons; for example,
            several studies (Kim &Lee, 2008; Kim, Lee, &Cormier, 2009; Kim, Lee,
            Cormier, &Youn, 2007; Youn &Kim, 2003) support this conclusion.
            <br />
            <br />
            To cite a direct quotation, give pages after the year, separated by
            a comma and a space. For example: "Smith argues that for something
            to happen it must be not only 'favorable and possible but also
            wanted and triggered' (2008, p.38)".

          <h3>3.3.2. List of References</h3>
          <p>
            References should be arranged first alphabetically and then further
            sorted chronologically if necessary. More than one reference from
            the same author(s) in the same year must be identified by the
            letters "a", "b", "c", etc., placed after the year of publication.

            in total are recommended. Please rewrite abstract to reach about 200
            words in total for this purpose. The abstract should state briefly

            3) the principal results, and 4) major conclusions in an
            unstructured manner. An abstract is often presented separately from

            non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if
            essential they must be defined at their first mention in the
            abstract itself.

            potential conflict of interest with any parties, including any
            financial, personal or other relationships with other people or
            organizations within three years of beginning the submitted work
            that could inappropriately influence or be perceived to influence.
            We confirm that the paper has not been published previously, it is

            Author identification: Every effort should be made to ensure that
            submission material outside of the title page file contains no clues
            as to author identity. Footnotes containing information pertaining
            to the identity of the author or institutional affiliation should be
            on separate pages. The complete title of the article and the name of
            the author(s) should be typed only on the title page file to ensure
            anonymity in the review process. Subsequent pages should have no
            author names, but may carry a short title at the top. Information in
            text, citations, references, or footnotes that would identify the
            author should be masked from the manuscript file. These may be
            reinserted in the final draft. In addition, the author's name should
            be removed from the document's Properties, which in Microsoft Word
            is found in the File menu. When submitting a revised version of a
            manuscript, please be sure to submit a blind version of your
            response letter detailing changes made to the manuscript as this is
            letter can be accessed by reviewers.
